A while back, Graeme Phillips put up a
[blog post](https://graemephi.github.io/posts/triangle-dft/)
asking "what happens
if you replace all the sine waves in the fourier transform with
triangle waves?"  It's a good post and you should go read it, but
there were a couple aspects Graeme didn't address that have been
sticking in my head.

Let's start by defining the basic triangular sine wave:

    def sbasis(x):
        if (x<-1) or (x>1):
            return 0
        if x < 0:
            return -sbasis(-x)
        if x <= 0.5:
            return 2*x
        else:
            return sbasis(1-x)

I'm not going to plot this, but it's got roots at x=-1, 0, 1, a
minimum at x=-0.5 and a maximum at x=0.5.  Just like $$\sin(\pi x)$$!

Then it's easy to get triangular sine waves of all (positive integral)
degrees:



    def tsin(n, x):
        rc = (x*n) % 2
        if rc>1:
            rc -= 2
        return sbasis(rc)

Triangular cosine works the same way:

    def cbasis(x):
        if (x<-1) or (x>1):
            return 0
        if x<0:
            return cbasis(-x)
        return 1-2*x

    def tcos(n, x):
        rc = (x*n) % 2
        if rc>1:
            rc -= 2
        return cbasis(rc)

And then the complex triangular exponential function in the obvious way:

    def texp(n, x):
        return tcos(n,x)+1j*tsin(n,x)

These are not orthonormal under the usual inner product:

$$IP(n,m) = (texp(n),texp(n)) = \int_{-1}^1 texp(n,x) conj(texp(n,x)) dx $$

as $$IP(0,0) = 2$$, and $$IP(n,n) = 4/3$$ for $$n \ge 1$$. They're not
even orthogonal, as for example $$IP(1,5) = 4/75$$.


But here's where I started to get interested.  Looking at $$IP(n,p)$$ for $$n=1$$ and $$p\ge 1$$, one gets:


| n  | p  | IP(1,p) |
|---|---:|---:|
|1|1|4/3|
|1|2|0|
|1|3|0|
|1|4|0|
|1|5|4/75|
|1|6|0|
|1|7|0|
|1|8|0|
|1|9|4/243|
|1|10|0|
|1|11|0|
|1|12|0|
|1|13|4/507|
|1|14|0|

And so on.  I certainly wasn't expecting that!   All the non-zero terms are
of the form $$\frac{4}{3q}$$, and furthermore :

| p | q |
|---:|---:|
|1|1|
|5|25|
|9|81|
|13|169|
|17|289|
|21|441|
|25|625|
|29|841|
|33|1089|

Which is a nice friendly sequence of offense towards none.




For n=2 it's a little messier:

|n|  p|   q|
|---|---:|---:|
|2 | 2  | 1|
|2 |10 | 25|
|2 |18 | 81|
|2 |26| 169|
|2 |34| 289|
|2| 42 |441|
|2 |50| 625|

Here the non-zero values are at a stride of 8,
instead of 4, and we have q=(p/2)**2.

Let's try n=3.

|n|  p|    q|  $$\sqrt{q}$$|
|---|---:|---:|---:|
|3 | 3 |    1  |   1
|3 | 7 |  441  |  21
|3 |11 | 1089   | 33
|3 |15 |   25  |   5
|3 |19 | 3249  |  57
|3 |23 | 4761  |  69
|3 |27  |  81  |   9
|3 |31  |8649  |  93

What is up with that IP(3,15)? Going by the surrounding values,
shouldn't it have sqrt(q)=45? And IP(3,3) doesn't match up either, nor does
IP(3,27).  We're back on a stride of 4 however,



It's looking as if when n divides p, we have $$q=(p/n)^2$$, and when it doesn't we have
$$q=(pn)^2.$$

This is consistent with the previous cases, sort of.
When n=1, we're always in the $$q=(p/n)^2 = p^2$$ case!
And when n=2, since p=8i+2 we're again seeing $$q=(p/n)^2$$.


Going to n=4, the plot thickens;

|n|   p |  q|
|---|---:|---:|
|4 |  4 |  1
|4 | 20 | 25
|4 | 36 | 81
|4 | 52 |169
|4 | 68 |289
|4 | 84| 441
|4 |100| 625

Now we're on a stride of 16!

Moving forward, n=5 does the same thing as n=3:

|n|   p |  q|
|---|---:|---:|
|5 | 5 |    1
|5 | 9 | 2025
|5 |13 | 4225
|5 |17 | 7225
|5 |21 |11025
|5 |25 |   25
|5 |29 |21025
|5 |33 |27225

as does n=7.

How about n=6?

|n|   p |  q|
|---|---:|---:|
|6 |6 |1
|6 |14 |441
|6 |22 |1089
|6 |30 |25
|6 |38 |3249
|6 |46 |4761
|6 |54 |81
|6 |62 |8649
|6 |70 |11025
|6 |78 |169
|6 |86 |16641
|6 |94 |19981
|6 |102 |289

This is the same as the n=3
sequence except that we're on a stride of 8 instead of 4.

In other words, n=6 is to n=3 as n=2 is to n=1
(or n=4 to n=2).  That means n=12 should be the n=3
sequence except on a stride of 16, and that's what we find:

|n|p|q|
|---|---:|---:|
|12 |12| 1  |
|12 |28 |441   |
|12 |44 |1089  |
|12 |60 |25    |
|12 |76 |3249  |
|12 |92 |4761   |
|12 |108 |81    |
|12 |124 |8649  |
|12 |140 |11025 |
|12 |156 |169   |
|12 |172 |16641 |
|12 |188 |19881 |
|12 |204 |289  |

Similarly, n=10 is the n=5 sequence on a stride of 8.

How about n=9?

|n|p|q|
|---|---:|---:|
|9|9|1
|9|13|13689
|9|17|23409
|9|21|441
|9|25|50625
|9|29|68121
|9|33|1089
|9|37|110889
|9|41|136161
|9|45|25
|9|49|194481
|9|53|227529
|9|57|3249


We're on a stride of 4, and whenever gcd(9,p) > 1 we have the
n=3 sequence appearing.  This suggests tha the "n divides p"
rule above needs to be modified.

But before that, and testing with n=15:

|n|p|q|$$\gcd(n,p)$$|
|---|---:|---:|---:|
|15|15|1|15
|15|19|81225|1
|15|23|119025|1
|15|27|2025|3
|15|31|216225|1
|15|35|441|5
|15|39|4225|3
|15|43|416025|1
|15|47|497025|1
|15|51|7225|3
|15|55|1089|5
|15|59|783225|1
|15|63|11025|3
|15|67|1010025|1
|15|71|1134225|1
|15|75|25|15
|15|79|1404225|1
|15|83|1550025|1
|15|87|21025|3
|15|91|1863225|1
|15|95|3249|5


Here we've got some trouble.  The rule needs to be modified again to
$$q = \left(\frac{n}{\gcd(n,p)}\right)^2\left(\frac{p}{\gcd(n,p)}\right)^2$$.

But the fun part is that this subsumes the two-part rule! (Since
$$\gcd(n,p) = 1$$ when n doesn't divide p, this reduces to
$$q=(np)^2$$.)




In summary,  letting $$n=2^tm$$,

$$
IP(n,p) = \begin{cases}
\left(\frac{n}{\gcd(n,p)}\right)^2\left(\frac{p}{\gcd(n,p)}\right)^2 & p \equiv n \mod 2^{t+2} \\
0 & e.w.
\end{cases}
$$


The end! No moral!
